# Budget, Mobile Application

I have always been interested in creating mobile applications. Additionally, I couldn't find a basic application that met my needs. In order to create the application I was seeking, I decided to learn React Native.

It's pretty simple. You put your monthly income and fixed expenses. Then, you choose how much you want to spend on groceries and gas each week.
Based on your budget, you will be able to determine how much you have left over.

Click on "+" to add what you bought, and the weekly remaining will adjust automatically.

A custom hook (usePersistedState) saves everything with AsyncStorage.

`npm install`
`npm start`
